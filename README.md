# 1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, components and features of a one-to-one video calling platform developed using WebRTC and ASP.NET.

1.2 Scope
This document covers the technical aspects of the video calling platform, including the system architecture, key components, and communication protocols.

# 2. System Overview
2.1 System architecture
The system follows a client-server architecture and uses WebRTC for real-time communication between clients. The server is implemented in ASP.NET and provides signaling and other necessary services.

2.2 Key Components
WebRTC Library: Used for real-time communication between clients.
User Interface: A web interface for users to initiate and participate in video calls.

# 3. Functional requirements
3.1 Video Call Management
Users can initiate one-on-one video calls.
Making, maintaining and ending video calls should be supported.

# 4. Non-functional Requirements
4.1 Security
WebRTC communication should be encrypted.
I have implemented secured coding practices to avoid common vulnerabilities.

# 5. Stack of technologies
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebRTC API.
Backend: ASP.NET 7, C#.

# 6. Future Improvements
Open to mass people with meeting function.

# 7. Conclusion
This system design document provides a comprehensive overview of the One-to-One Video Calling Platform architecture, components, and features. It serves as a guide for development.
